Lets build a new Gemini feature, following and aligning with the rules and docs allong the way at every possible step. The idea i want to flesh out and fully plan (to not leave anything unconfirmed to ensure our plan is flawless) but i want to make
an xp tracker, ill start by first explaining a bit how levels (aka Strength) works in game: every second all pets (that arent starving) in the ACTIVE PET SLOTS gain 1xp per second so 3600xp per hour base (each pet gets 3600xp individually)
There is then the XP Boost ability (and Snow (Snowy) XP Boost which only works during Snow Weather) this ability is held by either peacocks or goats with the XP boost ability, this ability has a set chance and amount of xp it CAN great ALL active
pets (depending on the XP Boost pets strength (which STR will need to be worked out by reviewing QPMs implementation of the XP tracker C:\Users\ryand\Feeder-Extension\QPM-GR and crosscheck with the games unminfied source bundle C:\Users\ryand\Feeder-Extension\magicgardenpreviewbundle\gg-preview-pr-2327-router.magiccircle.workers.dev)
so this feature needs to display all active pets, with their sprites and correct coloring, there name, species, current XP, Progress to Next STR, Time to Next STR (with indicator on how many feeds till next STR), Time to Max STR (with indicator on how many feeds till max STR), also if a Max STR XP Boost pet is being used with pets that are still gaining STR/levels then it needs to show the XP boost pets feeds till next/max str but in relation to the other levelling pets
it also needs to have a section where it pulls ALL pets from active pets, inventory, pet hutch and displays them in a sortable/filterable list of Pets Closest to Max STR
