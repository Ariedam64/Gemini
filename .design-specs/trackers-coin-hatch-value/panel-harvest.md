# Panel: Harvest (Deprecated)

This panel has been merged into the Value (coin) panel.
Do not implement a standalone Harvest panel.

Reasoning:
- Double Harvest and Crop Refund are coin outcomes and belong in the coin category.
- Stat rows are ability-specific and team-level, matching the Value panel layout.

Reference:
- See panel-value.md for the active plan.
